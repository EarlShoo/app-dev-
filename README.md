3. *“Dear Hae-in from the future, I doubt you’re watching this. But if you are, why are you? Turn this off and get to work. I won’t ask how you’re doing since I know you’ll be doing fine. You’ll be just as pretty, healthy, and the most successful. With Hyun-woo by your side, of course.” – Hong Hae In*
4. *“I’ve had two training wheels throughout my whole life. One was you and the other one was you. But now, I want to remove them and stand on my own two feet.” – Hong Soo Cheol*
